        <h1>My  OJT experience at the MDRRMO</h1>
           <p> As an OJT at the Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (MDRRMO) of the Municipality of Mabini, I gained valuable experience that broadened my knowledge and skills as an IT student. Under the guidance of Ma’am Mylene, it became easier for me to learn the tasks within the office and participate in the department’s activities.
            One of my main responsibilities was encoding the tasks assigned to me. Through this, I improved my skills in using Microsoft Office, particularly Word and Excel, and learned to be more organized and careful in handling information.
            Aside from computer-related tasks, I also learned essential knowledge in basic first aid, such as the proper way to use and fold gauze tape. Although it may seem simple, I realized how important every detail is when it comes to disaster preparedness.
            Overall, my experience at MDRRMO helped me develop not only my technical skills but also gave me a deeper understanding of the importance of public service, teamwork, and preparedness in times of disaster. I am truly grateful to the entire MDRRMO team, especially to Ma’am Mylene, for their support and trust in my capabilities as an OJT. create a short introduction for this</p>
