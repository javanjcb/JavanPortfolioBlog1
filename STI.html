        <h1>My STI Experience</h1>
      <p> What truly made my experience special were the people. I found friends who shared the same passion, and together we learned, failed, and succeeded. The teamwork, late-night group projects, and even casual bonding moments made STI feel like a second home.
        <br>
        Beyond the lessons in coding and IT, STI taught me life skills — how to communicate, collaborate, and step out of my comfort zone. The instructors weren’t just teachers; they were mentors who guided us with patience and care.
        <br>
        Looking back, I know I made the right choice. STI didn’t just give me an education — it helped me become a better version of myself.
        <br>
        I’m proud to be an STI’er. This journey was filled with laughter, learning, and growth. And to anyone thinking of joining STI — it’s more than just a school. It’s a place where your future begins.
        <br>
        Here’s to everything I’ve learned — and everything still ahead.</p>
