        <h1>My App Development Experience</h1>
        <p>
         In Sir Al’s subject, we created a mobile app called "Guess Number." The goal of the app is to provide entertainment by letting users guess a secret number. As a group, we worked from planning to testing, applying the programming skills we learned, such as input validation and loop control. We encountered challenges like debugging bugs and designing a user-friendly interface. Overall, this project was a meaningful experience that taught us the value of teamwork, patience, and proper guidance keys to the success of our app.
